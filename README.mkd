> [!TIP]
> After you're done, go to [your Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) page and stop or delete the machine to save time.
> I don't know how much is the monthly allowance, I never ran out though!

## 2. Locally

* Install Docker on your computer
* Install the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension on VSCode. (If you had any problems installing it, open an issue).
* Clone this repository
* Open it in VSCode.

A pop up gives you an option to pull the Docker image and run this repository inside it.

> [!NOTE]  
> The image is big (~3.5 Gigs), because it contains the database and the packages.
